# Xebiatest

Xebiatest is a Mobile Coding Test to build a news listing and detail screen. It's a simple app developed using MVVM architecture.

## Installation

Clone the app using below command and simply open the xcodeproj file to run the app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvikas8/Xebiatest.git
```

## Notes

- Due to time constraint I was not able to write test cases and optimise the app further, some tasks to do so are listed in Improvements section..
- App only support portrait mode for now.
- App is only tested in iOS (iPhone 11 Simulator) due to time constraint.

## Needed Improvements
- Error handling with proper error messages.
- Localizable strings
- Proper comments in the code to make it more understandable.
- Fastlane integration.
